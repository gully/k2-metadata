Proposed Targets
---


These csv files come from the Kepler/K2 Science Center's [Approved targets & programs page](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-approved-programs.html).

The number of lines is approximately equal to the number of targets in each campaign:

```bash
$ wc -l *
    7903 K2Campaign0targets.csv
   41532 K2Campaign10targets.csv
   32811 K2Campaign11targets.csv
   45952 K2Campaign12targets.csv
   26171 K2Campaign13targets.csv
   39027 K2Campaign14targets.csv
   35079 K2Campaign15targets.csv
   21648 K2Campaign1targets.csv
   16666 K2Campaign2targets.csv
   16834 K2Campaign3targets.csv
   17203 K2Campaign4targets.csv

    3418 K2Campaign9atargets.csv
    3551 K2Campaign9btargets.csv
  426147 total
```

The file sizes are not-too-huge:

```bash
$ du -hs *
384K	K2Campaign0targets.csv
2.1M	K2Campaign10targets.csv
1.7M	K2Campaign11targets.csv
2.5M	K2Campaign12targets.csv
