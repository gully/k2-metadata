# Tools

These are tools for managing the notebooks in this repository.

I copied these tools from the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) by Jake Vandeplas.  Thanks Jake!

- ``generate_contents.py``: this will generate a markdown table of contents for use in the README and in the Index.ipynb notebook

- ``add_navigation.py``: this script adds navigation links at the top and bottom of each notebook.

- ``add_book_info.py``: this script adds book information to the top of each notebook.
